# AI Knowledge Capture

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: After completing ANY task that produces new knowledge — fixing a bug, making a decision, discovering a pattern, finding a constraint — you MUST capture it in the knowledge base immediately. This is NOT optional.

## When to Capture

| Event | What to Document | Type |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| Bug fixed | Root cause, fix applied, how to prevent | `fix` |
| Technical decision made | Choice, reasoning, discarded alternatives | `decision` |
| Pattern identified | Convention, where used, why | `pattern` |
| Limitation found | Constraint, impact, workarounds | `constraint` |
| Unexpected behavior | The gotcha, workaround, why it happens | `gotcha` |

## How to Call

```
mcp__ai-knowledge__addKnowledge({
  content: "Description of what was learned",
  type: "fix" | "decision" | "pattern" | "constraint" | "gotcha",
  scope: "global" | "workspace:<project-name>",
  source: "Where this was discovered",
  tags: ["relevant", "tags"],
  confidenceScore: 0.9
})
```

## What NOT to Capture

Only store knowledge that **saves significant time in future sessions**. Do NOT capture:

- **Publicly documented facts** — standard API docs, language syntax, framework basics
- **Trivial fixes** — typos, missing imports, simple syntax errors
- **Temporary state** — work-in-progress notes, current debugging status

**Rule of thumb**: If a web search answers it in 30 seconds, don't store it. If it took 5+ minutes of investigation, store it.

## Update Existing Knowledge, Don't Duplicate

**CRITICAL**: Before calling `addKnowledge`, check if a related entry already exists from your initial query:

1. If yes → **UPDATE it** with `mcp__ai-knowledge__updateKnowledge(id, { content, tags })` instead of creating a new entry
2. If the existing entry is wrong → **DELETE it** with `mcp__ai-knowledge__deleteKnowledge(id)` and create a fresh one
3. Only **ADD** when the knowledge is genuinely new — no existing entry covers the topic

## Rules

- **LAST action of every task** — capture before finishing
- **No exceptions** — no task is "too simple" to capture knowledge from
- **All entries in English** — regardless of conversation language
- **Be concise but complete** — full context without re-investigation needed

## Scope Guidelines

| Scope | When |
|-------|------|
| `workspace:<project>` | Knowledge specific to one project |
| `global` | Cross-project knowledge |
