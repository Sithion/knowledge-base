## Knowledge Base Integration (cognistore)

> **BLOCKING REQUIREMENT** — You MUST follow these rules on EVERY task. No exceptions.
> Tools are provided by the `cognistore` MCP server.

### Mandatory Skills — ALWAYS Invoke

You have 3 skills that MUST be invoked automatically. These are NOT optional:

1. **`cognistore-query`** — MUST be your **FIRST action** in every task, before reading files, writing code, or making decisions. No exceptions.
2. **`cognistore-capture`** — MUST be your **LAST action** after completing any task that produced new knowledge (fixes, decisions, patterns, constraints).
3. **`cognistore-plan`** — **Output-based trigger**: if you produced 2+ ordered implementation steps (in ANY mode — plan mode, normal mode, any workflow), you MUST call `createPlan()`. During execution, track EVERY task via `updatePlanTask()` — `in_progress` BEFORE, `completed` AFTER.

### CHECKPOINT 1: Query First (cognistore-query)

**STOP. Before you read any file, write any code, or make any decision:**

```
mcp__cognistore__getKnowledge(query: "<describe the task or problem>")
```

- Similarity > 0.50: **Use directly** — skip redundant analysis
- Similarity 0.30–0.50: **Review** — combine with fresh analysis
- No results or < 0.30: Proceed with full analysis

### CHECKPOINT 2: Capture Last (cognistore-capture)

**Before finishing, capture what you learned:**

```
mcp__cognistore__addKnowledge({
  content: "<what was learned>",
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  type: "pattern|decision|fix|constraint|gotcha",
  scope: "global" or "workspace:<project-name>",
  source: "<origin>"
})
```

If an existing entry covers the topic, **UPDATE it** instead of creating a duplicate.

### CHECKPOINT 3: Plan Detection (output-based — applies in ALL modes)

**If you produced a multi-step approach, implementation steps, or any structured plan — regardless of mode — call `createPlan()`.**

```
mcp__cognistore__createPlan({
  title: "<plan title>",
  content: "<full plan>",
  tags: ["..."], scope: "workspace:<project>", source: "<context>",
  tasks: [{ description: "Step 1", priority: "high" }, ...]
})
```

- **ALWAYS** include a `tasks` array
- **ALWAYS** track execution: `updatePlanTask(taskId, {status: 'in_progress'})` BEFORE each task, `updatePlanTask(taskId, {status: 'completed', notes: '...'})` AFTER
- **ALWAYS** set plan to `active` when starting, `completed` when all tasks done

### Rules

1. **NEVER skip the knowledge query** — costs ~30 tokens; missing a hit wastes 2,000–8,000 tokens.
2. **All entries MUST be in English** — regardless of conversation language.
3. **Update, don't duplicate** — update existing entries when the topic already exists.
4. **Only store high-value knowledge** — non-obvious insights, not trivial fixes or standard docs.
5. **Any multi-step plan you produce MUST be persisted** — `createPlan()` whenever you write 2+ implementation steps, in ANY mode.
