## Quick Navigation

**Building the app?** Start with [Architecture](./architecture.md) then [CI/CD](./ci-cd.md).

**Adding a feature?** Check [Frontend](./frontend.md) for UI patterns and [API Reference](./api-reference.md) for backend endpoints.

**Debugging MCP?** See [MCP Server](./mcp-server.md) for tool details and [Database](./database.md) for search behavior.

**Modifying setup?** Read [Setup & Uninstall](./setup-uninstall.md) — remember the symmetry rule.

**Adding a new AI client?** Follow [Config Injection](./config-injection.md) patterns.

**Running agent tests?** See [CI/CD](./ci-cd.md) for the agent test battery (`scripts/test-agents.sh`).
